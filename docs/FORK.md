# Intentional fork behavior

Deliberate deviations of this fork from upstream `XTLS/Xray-core`. Keep them
when syncing upstream or fixing nearby code; each bullet names the tests that
guard it.

- REALITY client-version bounds are operator-configurable and carry no built-in
  default. `minClientVer` and `maxClientVer` are parsed and reach the REALITY
  handshake when the operator sets them; when either is omitted it stays nil and
  that side of the gate rejects nobody. Do not reintroduce upstream's implicit
  `26.3.27` minimum. Covered by `infra/conf/reality_clientver_test.go` and
  `transport/internet/reality/clientver_test.go`.
- The REALITY server runs from the in-tree module copy `third_party/reality`
  (a `replace` in `go.mod`). A Client Hello that offers X25519MLKEM768 in
  neither `supported_groups` nor `key_share` authenticates through its single
  X25519 key share; hellos that offer the hybrid group keep upstream's rules.
  `third_party/reality/FORK.md` lists every fork change and the update
  procedure. Covered by `transport/internet/reality/keyshare_test.go`.
- Every shipped and release-tested build uses Go 1.27.2 (`go.mod`) and
  `-tags http2legacy`. Without the tag, Go 1.27's x/net HTTP/2 client dials
  once per request while a TLS handshake hangs, defeating XHTTP
  `xmux.maxConnections` and producing connection bursts that censors block on
  (XTLS/Xray-core#6797). Covered by
  `transport/internet/splithttp/http2_dial_test.go` and
  `testing/release/build_contract_test.go`.
- XHTTP inbounds accept Mux.Cool TCP sessions; upstream (XTLS/Xray-core#4128)
  limits them to pure XUDP. In packet-up and stream-up the server can poke an
  idle downlink with a Mux.Cool KeepAlive (`xhttpSettings.muxKeepAliveSecs`
  and `muxKeepAliveBytes`, off by default); stream-one is never poked. Fields
  30 and 31 of the splithttp `Config` message are fork-owned: renumber them if
  upstream claims those numbers. Covered by `common/mux/server_test.go` and
  `common/singmux/xhttp_muxcool_integration_test.go`.
- XHTTP over HTTP/2 on TCP has an optional flow-control governor
  (`transport/internet/splithttp/h2flow*.go`), off unless `XRAY_XHTTP_FLOW=on`
  or `xhttpSettings.extra.h2Flow.enabled` turns it on; with it off the HTTP/2
  wiring is stock. Field 32 (`h2Flow`) of the splithttp `Config` message is
  fork-owned: renumber it if upstream claims that number.
  `transport/internet/splithttp/BASELINE.md` holds its benchmarks and gates.
  Covered by the `h2flow*_test.go` tests and
  `common/singmux/xhttp_flow_verify_integration_test.go`.
- The maintained SMUX implementation is the in-tree stack under
  `common/singmux`. Mux-related production code must not directly import
  SagerNet, MetaCubeX, Hashicorp, or another mux implementation.
- Preserve MPL-2.0 notices and provenance for MPL-derived code. Do not copy GPL
  files into this repository. A rewrite must be behavior-driven and must not
  silently change the wire protocol.
- SMUX is the active mux scope. Do not add YAMUX or H2MUX work unless the
  maintainer explicitly requests it.
